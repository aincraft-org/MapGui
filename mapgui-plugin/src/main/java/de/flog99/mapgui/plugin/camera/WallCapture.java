/**
 * The MapGUI walls in front of the camera, as pictures hanging on the blocks they are mounted to.
 *
 * <p>Everything else in a capture is read out of the world. A wall is not in the world at all - its maps and the
 * frames holding them are sent to each viewer's client and nothing is placed - so a capture that only looked at
 * blocks and entities found bare stone where the video was playing. This asks instead.
 *
 * <p>What the photographer is seeing rather than what the wall is showing in general, which is the same thing on a
 * shared wall and a different picture per person on a per-player one. Somebody who has walked out of range is being
 * sent nothing, and photographs nothing.
