/**
 * How often a live view may take a frame, so that viewfinders cost the server what they are given and no more.
 *
 * <p>A still photograph is not this problem - one capture is one capture, and whoever pressed the shutter waited for
 * it. A viewfinder is: it wants every frame it can get, forever, and the answer to "how many is that" depends on how
 * many other people are pointing one at the same time. Only the server can see all of them, so only the server can
 * divide the time, which is why the arithmetic is here rather than in whichever plugin drew the screen.
 *
 * <p>Two numbers decide it. A <b>budget</b> in milliseconds per tick, which is main-thread time and therefore the only
 * kind a capture can take from the server, and an <b>fps ceiling</b>, because past some rate a viewfinder stops
 * looking any better and only costs more. Everything between them is spent: viewers get as many frames as the budget
 * affords and stop at the ceiling, so one viewer does not get twenty times the frames just because they are alone.
 *
 * <p>What one frame costs is measured rather than assumed, per viewer, because it genuinely differs - a 64-pixel
 * viewfinder pointed at a wall copies a fraction of what a 128-pixel one pointed across a valley does. The division
 * is therefore of time and not of frames: two viewers with different costs get the rates their own costs earn.
