/**
 * The drawn block entities of a column, kept between captures for as long as a copied column is.
 *
 * <p>Because that is what they are. A chest, a sign, a banner, a bell: they do not move, and what they look like
 * changes when somebody edits a sign or puts something on a shelf rather than every tick. A mob is the opposite and
 * is never cached - a stale mob is drawn where it is not - but a stale chest is very nearly always the same chest.
 *
 * <p>Graded by distance like everything else the camera holds - see {@link ReuseWindow} - but in blocks rather than
 * chunks, because the whole gather is capped at 64 blocks and a chunk-wide ramp would have barely begun by then.
 *
 * <p>Nothing that animates is on this path, which is what makes half a second safe. An item frame - a map filling
 * in, or one of MapGUI's own walls playing - is an <i>entity</i>, drawn by {@code EntityCapture} against
 * {@code FramedMaps}, and the entity path holds nothing between captures at all.
 *
 * <p>Held per column and unfiltered, rather than per capture and filtered by distance from the eye. A photographer
 * takes a step between frames, so a list built against where they were standing would be subtly wrong for where
 * they are now - and a cache that has to be rebuilt whenever the camera moves is not a cache. The distance test is
 * applied to what comes back instead, which is arithmetic on a snapshot that already exists.
