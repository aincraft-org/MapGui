/**

 *
 * <p><b>Is there a session</b> decides whether MapGUI cares at all. <b>Does it have the mouse</b> decides whether
 * the input is the menu's rather than the world's - and for anything but a popup that changes while the session is
 * up, because putting the map away is the point of carrying it. So a handler that stops the player interacting with
 * the world asks {@link #focused}, and only the ones that defend the map itself ask {@link #active}.

     * The scroll wheel, which means one of two things depending on what the player is carrying.

     * <p>For a popup it is the menu's own scroll. Every slot shows the same map so which is selected changes
     * nothing visible, and the change is deliberately <b>not</b> canceled: letting it through keeps the server in
     * step with the client, which is what makes the notch count exact. Refusing it froze the server a slot behind,
     * so a three-notch flick arrived as 1 + 2 + 3.
     *
     * <p>For a map that is one item among the player's own, the wheel is theirs: scrolling off the map puts it away
     * and scrolling back picks it up. The menu's scroll moves to <b>shift+scroll</b>, which has to be canceled,
     * because shift does not stop the client changing slots - it would scroll the menu and drop the map out of the
     * player's hand in the same motion. Canceling puts the selection back, since CraftBukkit answers a refused
     * change by resending the slot the server still thinks is selected.
     *
     * <p>Which is also why that path counts direction rather than distance. The base never moves, so a fast flick
     * arrives as +1, +2, +3 against the same slot - three notches read as six. The sign of each is one notch each.
