/**
 * How far this server sends entities to a client, so that a capture draws the same ones the photographer can see.
 *
 * <p>A ceiling and a truth, meeting at whichever is nearer. {@code camera.max-entity-distance} is what an admin will
 * pay to draw, since every entity in range is a part tree to build; the server's own tracking range is what the
 * photographer's client was actually sent. The smaller of the two means a capture can never hold a mob that is not
 * on their screen, and never costs more than the ceiling allows however far the server tracks.
 *
 * <p>It used to be the ceiling alone, at a flat 64, under a comment guessing that was "roughly where the client stops
 * sending them". It is not - the shipped ranges are 96 for mobs and 128 for players - so the guess was right about
 * what it should cost and wrong about why.
 *
 * <p>Trimmed by {@link #MARGIN} rather than taken flat. An entity exactly at the tracking edge is one the client may
 * or may not have been sent depending on which side of a step it was on when the packet went out, and a photograph
 * that includes something the photographer cannot see is a worse failure than one that leaves out something at the
 * very limit of visibility - at that distance it is a pixel either way.
 *
 * <p>Per category, because the server is: a player at a hundred blocks is visible and a cow at a hundred blocks is
 * not, and drawing them by one rule would get one of the two wrong.
