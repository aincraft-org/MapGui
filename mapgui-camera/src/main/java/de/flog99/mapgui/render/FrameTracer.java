/**
 * A frame traced across several threads, as bands of rows.

 * {@link RayTracer} keeps its scratch per instance, so one tracer per thread and a band each leaves nothing to
 * synchronize. Bands rather than tiles, because a row is contiguous in the output array and two threads writing
 * neighbouring rows never touch the same cache line.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the common pool: a capture is background work on somebody's game server, and a small pool of
 * named daemon threads is easier to account for in a profile and cannot outlive the plugin.
